## Polarization of a Coherent Light Source

It's a well known fact that, classically speaking, light travels as a wave. More specifically, it will travel as a transverse electro-magnetic wave. This means that the propogation direction, the direction of the electric field, and the direction of the magnetic field of the wave are all mutually orthogonal. [^1]

The direction that the electric field points for such a wave is commonly known as the polarization of the wave. This polarization is typically described as an angle between 0 and 90 degrees, representing how much the electric field is "rotated" from the vertical. Coherent light sources such as lasers have a constant, measurable polarization. Due to this, we can also tune the polarization of the source through various means.
