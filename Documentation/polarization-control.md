## Polarization of a Coherent Light Source

### Linear Polarization
It's a well known fact that, classically speaking, light travels as a wave. More specifically, it will travel as a transverse electro-magnetic wave. This means that the propogation direction, the direction of the electric field, and the direction of the magnetic field of the wave are all mutually orthogonal. [^1]

The direction that the electric field points for such a wave is commonly known as the polarization of the wave. This polarization is typically described as an angle between 0 and 90 degrees, representing how much the electric field is "rotated" from the vertical. Coherent light sources such as lasers have a constant, measurable polarization. Due to this, we can also tune the polarization of the source through various means.

### Circular Polarization

We can also have a polarization that predicably rotates in time and space, known as circular polarization (see the figure below). [^2]

This polarization is unique because the linear polarization is generally unable to be measured directly, needing more advanced techniques to analyse. It's also worth noting that individual photons carry only a circular polarization, so for non-classical applications circular polarization must be considered.

## Polarizers

The simplest method of tuning the polarization of a light source is through a polarizer. Polarizers act as a "screen" for polarization states, letting only the chosen direction of polarization through. These components are extremely limited however, as they
