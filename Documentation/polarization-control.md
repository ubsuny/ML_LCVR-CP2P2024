# Polarization Control with Liquid Crystal Variable Retarders

## Polarization of a Coherent Light Source

It's a well known fact that, classically speaking, light travels as a wave. More specifically, it will travel as a transverse electro-magnetic wave. This means that the propogation direction, the direction of the electric field, and the direction of the magnetic field of the wave are all mutually orthogonal. [^1]
