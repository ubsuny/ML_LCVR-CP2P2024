    "# Using the lcvr_learning Class to Measure Training Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To train our model, it helps to have a large amount of training data. While this can be measured and calibrated by hand, it can take several hours for a single wavelength to get the data. On top of this, changing the orientation of the LCVR's will then change the necessary driving voltage for different polarizations, resulting in prior training data being useless. To combat this, the class has an automated function for collecting training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we need to import the library. In addition, we set the device to our input channel on our ADC module. This is required to know where the data is being read from. We can also set the function generator being used for the square wave as well, which *should* work so long as it follows the same SCPI command syntax as the Siglent 2042x. Otherwise the functions that read and write parameters to the function generators may need to be modified."
